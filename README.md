# Self-Driving-Car

Building a self driving car from scratch!

Developing a fully autonomous car using Udacity's Car Simulator using python. I'll describe various approaches for preprocessing the dataset obtained from the simulator. Further, I will be recreating NVIDIA's End-To-End Self Driving neural network framework from start to train the model.
